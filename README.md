Who wants to be a millionaire?

1. Introduction

There are 15 questions. Each question is connected to a certain amount (in $): 
50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, 125000, 250000, 500000 and 1000000. All questions must be answered correctly to win 
the million (the last question).
There a similar coding blocks for all 15 questions:
- The user can choose between four answer possbilities (A to D), he can pick a lifeline (E) or quit (F).
- Lifelines (if available):
	- 50:50: Two wrong answers are being removed. After that, the user has to choose one of the two remaining answers.
	- Phone a Friend: The user can call a friend. That means, he chooses the name of the friend who then returns the correct answer with the probability of 60 %. 
	- After that, the user can decide whether he follows the advice of his friend, choose another lifeline or quit. 
	- Ask the Audience: The audience will be asked. It returns the correct answer with a probability of 75 %. 
	- After that, the user can decide whether he follows the vote of the audience, choose another lifeline or quit. 
	- Each lifeline can be used only once in the whole game.
If the answer is correct, the game continues with the next question.
If it is wrong there are three possibilites depending on which question has been reached:
	- Between 0 $ and 500 $: User won 0 $, game over.
	- Between 1000 $ and 16000 $: User won 500 $, game over.
	- Between 32000 $ and 1000000 $: User won 16000 $, game over.
      
2. Design and Implementation

Every question is designed as object of the class Question. Attributes are for example the question itself, the four possible answers, 
and also the probabilities for the weighted random choices of the lifelines Phone a Friend and Ask the Audience.

The questions (the objects) are connected to each other as a simply linked list. So, when the user got a question right, 
immediately the next question will be presented to him. 

Part of the algorithm are five functions:
- pose_question():
	This is the most important function. The questions are being posed. It presents the answer possibilities and specifies if the 
  answer was correct or not.
- lifeline():
	Here a counter for the lifelines is enforced, as each can only be used once. Also it initiates the chosen lifeline.
- For each lifeline a function is implementd which ensures the execution of the specific lifeline.
